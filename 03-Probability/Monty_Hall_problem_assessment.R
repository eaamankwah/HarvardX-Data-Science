############ PROBLEM 1 #############
# Assign a variable 'n' as the number of remaining games.
n <- 6

# Assign a variable `outcomes` as a vector of possible game outcomes, where 0 indicates a loss and 1 indicates a win for the Cavs.
outcomes <- c(0,1)

# Assign a variable `l` to a list of all possible outcomes in all remaining games. Use the `rep` function on `list(outcomes)` to create list of length `n`.
l <- rep(list(outcomes), n)

# Create a data frame named 'possibilities' that contains all combinations of possible outcomes for the remaining games.
possibilities <- expand.grid(l)

# Create a vector named 'results' that indicates whether each row in the data frame 'possibilities' contains enough wins for the Cavs to win the series.
results <- rowSums(possibilities)>=4

# Calculate the proportion of 'results' in which the Cavs win the series. Print the outcome to the console.
mean(results)



############ PROBLEM 2 #############
# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the simulation to run. Let's run the Monte Carlo simulation 10,000 times.
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling.
set.seed(1)

# Create an object called `results` that replicates for `B` iterations a simulated series and determines whether that series contains at least four wins for the Cavs.
results <- replicate(B, {
  cavs_wins <- sample(c(0,1), 6, replace = TRUE)
  sum(cavs_wins)>=4
})

# Calculate the frequency out of `B` iterations that the Cavs won at least four games in the remainder of the series. Print your answer to the console.
mean(results)

############ PROBLEM 3 #############
# Let's assign the variable 'p' as the vector of probabilities that team A will win.
p <- seq(0.5, 0.95, 0.025)

# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(p){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), 7, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=4
  })
  mean(result)
}

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of probabilities that team A will win to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object 'Pr'.
Pr <- sapply(p, FUN=prob_win)

# Plot the probability 'p' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(p, Pr)

############ PROBLEM 4 #############
# Given a value 'p', the probability of winning the series for the underdog team B can be computed with the following function based on a Monte Carlo simulation:
prob_win <- function(N, p=0.75){
  B <- 10000
  result <- replicate(B, {
    b_win <- sample(c(1,0), N, replace = TRUE, prob = c(1-p, p))
    sum(b_win)>=(N+1)/2
  })
  mean(result)
}

# Assign the variable 'N' as the vector of series lengths. Use only odd numbers ranging from 1 to 25 games.
N <- seq(from=1, to=25, by=2)

# Apply the 'prob_win' function across the vector of series lengths to determine the probability that team B will win. Call this object `Pr`.
Pr <- sapply(N, FUN=prob_win)

# Plot the number of games in the series 'N' on the x-axis and 'Pr' on the y-axis.
plot(N, Pr)
